I use Github mainly for fun projects. It means I actually follow online tutorials to see and learn how others set up projects and solve their problems. I find this relaxing, but by no means am I demeaning online YouTube projects, I do not use GitHub to put up projects to showcase how I think in developing code. Let me put it this way: I follow the textbook way of solving problems. So when I put up a Next.js project, I will follow the Next.js manual and handbooks. The simpler a solution can be, the happier I am. I have found that a lot of times, we developers love complicating things. This is because we usually think First code, second code, third code, and MAYBE, just MAYBE by the fourth level, we think about how people actually use the code and if they even need our solutions the way we think they need them. 

I guess that my academic training in sociology and scientific research, and my love for anything UX, is rubbing off on my way of thinking about software development.
